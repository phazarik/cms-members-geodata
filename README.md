# CMS Members Geodata

This repository provides geospatial data and tools to visualize the geographic distribution of CMS collaboration members. It imports institutional locations and maps them interactively using OpenStreetMap.

## Overview

The project collects latitude and longitude coordinates of CMS member institutes worldwide and generates interactive maps to display their global distribution. These maps help analyze CMS collaboration's geographical reach and institutional diversity.


## Data Sources and Map Credits

Institutes information: [iCMS: Institutes](https://icms.cern.ch/tools/collaboration/institutes)

## Features

- Import and process CMS member institute data with geographic coordinates.
- Generate interactive maps using OpenStreetMap.
- Display individual institutes as points on the map.
- Maps are recognized by the United Nations; note that acceptance by individual countries may vary.
