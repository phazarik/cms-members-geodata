# CMS Members Geodata

This repository provides geospatial data and tools to visualize the geographic distribution of CMS collaboration members. It imports institutional locations and maps them interactively using OpenStreetMap. The latitude and longitude for each institute are generated using GrokAI.

## üîß Prerequisites

This project is built using Jupyter Notebooks and the following Python libraries are used, all installable via `conda-forge`.

## üì•Interactive map

The interactive map shows the geographic locations of CMS collaboration institutes worldwide using base tiles from OpenStreetMap and CartoDB Voyager. Each institute is marked based on its latitude and longitude, with popups displaying details like name, town, and country. The map allows switching between base layers and is recognized by the United Nations, though individual countries may view it differently.
